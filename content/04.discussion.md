### Epistasis between germline mutator alleles

In our study, we discovered a specific area on chromosome 6 that significantly increases a type of genetic mutation (C>A) in the BXDs, a group of inbred mice created from the DBA/2J and C57BL/6J laboratory strains.
When mice possess the DBA/2J (*D*) version of this gene without the C57BL/6J (*B*) version from a known mutation-related gene on chromosome 4, we observed no notable change in mutation rates.
However, mice carrying the *D* version from both genes exhibit a much higher rate of mutations compared to those with the *D* version from the chromosome 4 gene alone (as shown in Figure @fig:spectra-comparison).
This phenomenon, where the interaction between two mutation-related genes leads to an increased mutation rate, has been reported in studies with yeast [@PMID:16492773] and human cell lines [@PMID:35859169].
However, this is the first time, to our knowledge, that such interactions have been demonstrated in a whole-animal model.

In our study, we found an interaction between specific genetic variants that increase mutation rates in the germ cells of laboratory mice, which are not naturally occurring but have been bred in a highly controlled environment through brother-sister mating [@PMID:33472028].
This breeding method likely reduces the impact of natural selection, allowing even harmful genetic variants to persist unless they are extremely detrimental [@doi:10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173437].
As a result, genetic variants that significantly increase mutation rates might become more common in these laboratory mice compared to their wild counterparts.
However, without more detailed genetic analysis, we cannot determine whether the genetic variant we found on chromosome 6 originated from laboratory mice or from wild mice.
If this variant has even a slight negative effect on the mice's fitness, it's more likely that it appeared in a laboratory setting.
This is because in the wild, natural selection tends to eliminate variants that increase mutation rates.
However, in the laboratory, where selection pressure is reduced, mutation rates can increase rapidly.
This could explain why a similar genetic variant was found in a research colony of rhesus macaques [@doi:10.1101/2023.03.27.534460] and why domesticated animals often have higher mutation rates than their wild relatives [@PMID:36859541].
Although we haven't pinpointed the exact genetic change on chromosome 6 responsible for increased mutation rates, we believe that changes in the DNA glycosylase *Ogg1*, which could alter its function or regulation, are likely candidates.


### Protein-coding genes that may underlie the chromosome 6 mutator locus

The discussion of our study reveals that five genes, all involved in the critical process of DNA repair, are located within or near the region identified as influencing the rate at which mutations occur on chromosome 6.
These genes include *Ogg1*, which plays a role in repairing oxidative DNA damage by removing the harmful 8-oxoguanine lesion [@PMID:17581577], and *Setmar*, which is part of the machinery that fixes breaks in both strands of DNA through a process known as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [@PMID:21187428;@PMID:16332963].
Other genes in this region are *Fancd2* and *Rad18*, with *Mbd4* also being relevant but located slightly outside the core area of interest on chromosome 6, yet still within a significant proximity that warrants attention.

While it remains uncertain which specific gene or genes are directly responsible for the observed increase in mutation rates, *Ogg1* emerges as a particularly strong candidate for further investigation.
This gene not only operates within the same repair pathway as *Mutyh*, a gene implicated in a similar mutational phenomenon on chromosome 4, but it also exhibits a notable genetic variation between the two mouse strains studied and is influenced by genetic regulatory elements in various tissues within the studied mouse population.
This convergence of factors makes *Ogg1* a prime focus for understanding the genetic underpinnings of mutation rate variability in laboratory mice.

In our study, we compared the genetic sequences of two strains of laboratory mice, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, specifically looking at the *Setmar* gene, which is involved in repairing DNA.
We found two differences in the gene that could potentially change its function (Table @tbl:nonsyn-diffs).
One of these differences is thought to be harmful based on computer predictions.
In primates, the equivalent gene (*SETMAR*) helps fix breaks in DNA strands, a crucial process for maintaining genetic integrity.
This repair process relies on two parts of the gene: one that adds methyl groups (SET methyltransferase domain) and another derived from a type of DNA sequence known as a *Mariner* transposase domain.
References from previous studies [@PMID:16332963;@PMID:24573677;@PMID:21491884] support this understanding.
However, the mouse version of the gene lacks the *Mariner* transposase part.
Additionally, the way primate *SETMAR* repairs DNA does not seem to influence the specific type of DNA mutation we are studying in mice (C>A mutations), leading us to believe that *Setmar* is not responsible for the differences in mutation rates we observed between the two mouse strains in our experiments (see *Supplementary Information*).

Furthermore, when we looked for genetic markers that would indicate how strongly the *Setmar* gene is expressed in different tissues of the BXD mice (a mix of the two strains), we didn't find any significant markers (Table @tbl:eqtl-results).
This suggests that the expression of *Setmar* is not being significantly altered in these mice in a way that would affect mutation rates.
We also examined other genes involved in DNA repair, such as *Fancd2* and *Rad18*, but found no differences in their genetic code that would explain the variation in mutation rates between the two mouse strains.
Interestingly, the only notable genetic marker we found was related to the *Fancd2* gene in the gut, where it was associated with higher gene expression, not lower (Table @tbl:eqtl-results).
This finding does not support the idea that these DNA repair genes are behind the different mutation rates we observed.


<!-- We also note that *FANCD2* deficiency in human cancer can lead to increased rates of *de novo* structural variation [@PMID:36450981]. -->

### An *Ogg1* mutator allele might impair the excision of 8-oxoguanine lesions

The *Ogg1* gene is part of the base-excision repair (BER) pathway, similar to *Mutyh*, a gene we previously identified as carrying mutator alleles on chromosome 4.
These genes play unique roles in the BER pathway’s response to oxidative DNA damage, which is crucial for preventing C>A mutations.
When DNA is damaged by reactive oxygen species, *Ogg1* identifies and removes 8-oxoguanine lesions paired with cytosine.
After the removal of 8-oxoG, other BER pathway components repair the site to restore the correct G:C base pair.
If an 8-oxoG lesion remains when the cell is preparing to divide, an adenine might be incorrectly placed opposite 8-oxoG during DNA replication.
In such cases, *Mutyh* removes the incorrect adenine, creating a gap that is then filled with a cytosine by other BER proteins, allowing the C:8-oxoG pair to be corrected by *Ogg1*. 

Issues in the BER pathway’s response to oxidative damage can significantly increase C>A mutation rates.
For instance, mice engineered without *Ogg1*, *Mutyh*, and *Mth1* (another enzyme that stops 8-oxo-dGTP from being used during DNA synthesis) show a dramatic 100-fold increase in 8-oxoG in their reproductive cells.
Almost all (99%) of the new germline mutations in these triple knockout mice are C>A transversions, underscoring the importance of repairing 8-oxoG in preventing this type of mutation.
Furthermore, changes in the *Ogg1* gene, such as missense mutations and loss of heterozygosity, have been linked to a higher risk of cancer in humans.
Similarly, reduced copies of either *Ogg1* or *Mutyh* are associated with increased spontaneous C>A mutations in human neuroblastoma cells.
This evidence collectively highlights the critical role of the BER pathway, and specifically *Ogg1* and *Mutyh*, in maintaining genetic stability by preventing harmful mutations.

#### Nonsynonymous mutations may underlie the chromosome 6 mutator phenotype

The p.Thr95Ala missense variant in the *Ogg1* gene is not considered harmful according to the computational prediction tool SIFT (Smith et al., 2003), and it occurs in a genetic region that does not show strong conservation across different mammalian species, as shown in our data (Table 1).
Additionally, we found that the *D* allele of p.Thr95Ala is present at an allele frequency of about 26% among wild *Mus musculus domesticus* populations and is the only allele found in other wild mouse populations, including *Mus musculus musculus*, *Mus musculus castaneus*, and *Mus spretus*.
Although one might initially expect that a deficiency in *Ogg1* would lead to an accumulation of 8-oxoG and subsequently higher C>A mutation rates, our findings suggest that the p.Thr95Ala variant may not be significantly harmful by itself.
It appears that this variant may only show a noticeable impact on the base excision repair (BER) gene network when there is also a deficiency in *Mutyh* function.
Another possibility is that the *D* alleles at *Ogg1* could cause a very slight increase in C>A mutation rates, which we may not have the statistical power to detect in our study of BXD mouse strains.

#### No indication of causal structural variation or mobile element insertions near the chromosome 6 mutator locus

In our discussion above, we suggested that the *Ogg1* gene appears to be the most promising candidate to account for the newly observed C>A mutator phenotype in BXD mice.
However, we must acknowledge that we cannot definitively confirm that the p.Thr95Ala missense mutation in *Ogg1* is the direct cause of this phenotype.
Previously, we had speculated that missense mutations in the *Mutyh* gene, found on *D* haplotypes, were behind the pronounced C>A mutator effect seen in BXD mice (PMID:35545679).
Yet, more recent investigations, including long-read genome sequencing of various inbred mouse strains, have pointed towards a different potential cause: a mobile element insertion (MEI) of approximately 5,000 base pairs in the first intron of *Mutyh* (doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100291).
This insertion is linked to a notable decrease in *Mutyh* expression in embryonic stem cells.
In light of this, we examined these new, high-quality genetic sequences for any signs of mobile elements or other significant structural variations near the mutator locus on chromosome 6.
Despite our efforts, we found no clear evidence to suggest that such variations are responsible for the mutator phenotype discussed in our study.

#### Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) might mediate germline mutator phenotypes in the BXDs

In our study, we identified significant genetic markers (cis-eQTLs) linked to the expression of the *Ogg1* gene in various tissues of the BXD mouse strains, as shown in Table @tbl:eqtl-results.
For each tissue examined, the presence of the *D* genotype corresponded with a reduced level of *Ogg1* expression.
Building on this, recent advancements using comprehensive genome sequencing have uncovered that an insertion of a mobile genetic element within an intron of the *Mutyh* gene could be the underlying cause for its diminished expression.
This reduction in *Mutyh* expression is likely leading to an increase in C>A type mutations in BXD strains carrying the *D* haplotype at the chromosome 4 mutator locus [@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100291].
These findings together suggest an intriguing scenario where mutator genes located on chromosomes 4 and 6 might be driving up C>A mutation rates through a common mechanism: by suppressing the activity of genes involved in the same DNA repair pathway.


### *Mbd4* may buffer the effects of *Mutyh* mutator alleles by triggering apoptosis

As mentioned in the **Results**, *Mbd4* lies just outside of the 90% bootstrap confidence interval on chromosome 6.
Due to the uncertainties associated with bootstrap confidence intervals in QTL mapping [@PMID:16783000], we have included a discussion of the evidence supporting *Mbd4* as a causal gene below.

In contrast to the *Ogg1* p.Thr95Ala mutation, the p.Asp129Asn mutation in *Mbd4* is situated within a recognized protein domain (specifically, the *Mbd4* methyl-CpG binding domain).
This mutation occurs at a location in the DNA and an amino acid that are both highly conserved across species, indicating its importance.
It is also forecasted to be harmful according to SIFT analysis (refer to Table @tbl:nonsyn-diffs for details) [@PMID:12824425].
Similarly, a related mutation affecting the same amino acid in humans (known as p.Asp142Gly in the GRCh38/hg38 human genome reference) is identified in a single genetic variation in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) [@PMID:32461654].
This human variant is also predicted to be harmful ("deleterious") and likely to cause damage ("probably damaging") to human genomes, according to evaluations by SIFT and Polyphen, respectively [@PMID:20354512].

A surprising finding from our study is that the loss of function in the *Mbd4* gene does not usually lead to the expected increase in C>A mutations, which are changes in the DNA sequence.
Typically, when *Mbd4* is not working properly, we see more C>T changes at specific DNA sites, known as CpG sites.
Interestingly, in our experiments with BXD mice, which have a particular genetic variation at a mutation-related region on chromosome 6, we did not observe an increase in these C>T mutations (Figure @fig:spectra-comparison-all).
However, it's important to note that when *Mbd4* is not functioning, it can make the effects of external DNA-damaging agents worse.
For example, studies have shown that cells from mouse embryos missing both copies of *Mbd4* do not self-destruct as they normally would when exposed to certain chemicals and mutagens, which are substances that can cause mutations [@PMID:14614141].
These damaging agents typically require a DNA repair system, known as mismatch repair (MMR), to fix the harm they cause.
Yet, even with damage that does not rely on MMR for repair, like that from gamma radiation, cells missing *Mbd4* still show a weaker self-destruct response [@PMID:14562041].
Moreover, mice with both *Mbd4* genes turned off develop intestinal tumors more quickly if they also carry a genetic variant in the *Apc* gene, which makes them more likely to get these tumors [@PMID:12130785].
Additionally, in some colon cancer cell lines from mice, losing *Mbd4* has been linked to a slight increase in mutation rates, including more C>A mutations in some cases [@PMID:17285135].
This evidence supports the idea that *Mbd4* plays a complex role in protecting the genome from mutations, and its absence can influence the mutation process in various ways, depending on the context.

The evidence we've gathered points to the *Mbd4* gene having a significant role in how sensitive cells are to various external factors that can cause mutations, possibly by influencing the decision on whether cells with DNA damage should self-destruct (apoptosis) [PMID:14614141; PMID:14562041].
We think that in mice with a compromised ability to repair a specific type of DNA damage (8-oxoguanine), due to a faulty version of the *Mutyh* gene, reactive oxygen species (ROS) could lead to an increased accumulation of DNA damage in reproductive cells.
If these cells have a fully working *Mbd4* gene, they might still be able to activate the self-destruction process, helping to counteract the negative effects of the faulty *Mutyh* gene.
On the other hand, mice with a decreased function in both the *Mbd4* and *Mutyh* genes might struggle to initiate this crucial self-destruct sequence in response to DNA damage.
As a result, their reproductive cells could end up with even more damage caused by ROS, which could significantly increase the rate of specific mutations in their germline.

We anticipate that future experimental work will be able to more conclusively establish a mechanistic explanation for the epistatic interaction between mutator loci described in this paper.

### Strengths and limitations of the aggregate mutation spectrum distance approach

In our study, we introduced a method called aggregate mutation spectrum distance (AMSD) to identify a specific genetic variation, known as a mutator allele, that was overlooked by a more traditional method called quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.
To assess the effectiveness of both methods, we conducted simulations under various conditions.
Our findings suggest that AMSD and QTL mapping are equally effective in identifying mutator alleles when looking at genetic sequences with a large number of new germline mutations (as shown in Figure @fig:ihd_vs_qtl_power).
However, AMSD proved to be superior in detecting a particular mutator allele located on chromosome 6 in a group of laboratory mice known as BXDs.
This indicates that AMSD can be more effective than QTL mapping in certain situations, especially when analyzing genetic sequences with varying numbers of mutations (Figure @fig:ihd_vs_qtl_power_variable_counts).

The BXD mice used in our study were bred over nearly 40 years, resulting in older lines having significantly more mutations than the newer lines.
Consequently, the genetic mutation patterns in the younger BXDs are much less consistent.
Unlike QTL mapping, which treats the data from each mouse equally, AMSD looks at the combined mutation patterns across different genetic locations.
This approach likely made it easier to identify mutator alleles in the BXD dataset, showcasing the potential advantages of AMSD in specific research contexts.

Another advantage of the AMSD method is that it eliminates the necessity to conduct separate association tests for each potential $k$-mer mutation type, thereby avoiding the requirement to adjust significance thresholds for multiple comparisons.
By comparing the entire mutation spectrum between haplotypes carrying different alleles at a specific site, AMSD is also effectively equipped to identify a mutator allele that simultaneously influences several $k$-mer mutation types (for instance, elevating both C>T and C>A mutation rates).

<!-- Finally, we find that IHD outperforms QTL mapping when simulated mutators are present at allele frequencies that substantially deviate from 50% ().
This feature of inter-haplotype distance may prove especially useful when mapping mutator alleles in natural, outbreeding populations, in which the effects of negative selection will likely keep mutators at relatively low population frequencies.  -->

The AMSD method, while innovative, encounters several limitations when contrasted with the more established QTL mapping techniques.
QTL mapping, particularly advanced versions like R/qtl2 (referenced in [@PMID:30591514]), employs linear models that facilitate testing the relationship between genetic markers (genotypes) and observable traits (phenotypes).
This approach allows for a comprehensive analysis by incorporating both additive and interactive variables, as well as family lineage data, into the examination of genetic traits.
Despite our efforts to adapt the AMSD method to consider the genetic relatedness between samples (as detailed in the *Materials and Methods* section), it lacks the versatility found in QTL mapping's analytical tools.
Moreover, the AMSD approach is predicated on the assumption that mutator genes influence only specific types of genetic mutations, represented by $k$-mer mutation types.
This means if a mutator gene were to uniformly increase mutation rates across all types on its haplotypes, the AMSD method would fail to recognize this effect.

### Discovering mutator alleles in other experimental systems

The identification of a second mutator allele in the BXD strain highlights the effectiveness of using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for unraveling the complex genetic factors influencing germline mutation rates.
RILs are available in large numbers for various model organisms, suggesting that with the decreasing costs of whole-genome sequencing, the AMSD method could become a valuable tool for identifying mutator alleles in populations beyond the BXDs.
However, it's important to recognize that RILs represent a limited resource, the creation of which demands significant time and effort.
Consequently, if the detection of germline mutator alleles is confined to these specialized experimental populations, it's probable that only a small portion of existing mutator alleles in the natural world will be identified.

The method we've developed in this study offers a promising avenue for analyzing a wide range of data, not just restricted to recombinant inbred lines (RILs) like those from laboratory mice.
In recent years, the sequencing of thousands of human family trees has been undertaken with the goal of accurately measuring the rate at which new genetic mutations occur in humans.
This effort is documented in several studies [@PMID:31549960;@PMID:28959963;@PMID:29700473].
Additionally, the practice of sequencing entire families is becoming increasingly common in diagnosing various inherited disorders, leading to a rapidly expanding collection of data.
Particularly, large groups of families spanning two or three generations present an ideal scenario for our method, named Aggregate Mutation Spectrum Distance (AMSD), to be highly effective.
By combining the mutation data from many individuals who all carry a potential mutation-causing gene variant, even a faint signal indicating a higher rate of mutation could be detected amidst the background noise of normal mutation rates.

However, it's important to point out that before AMSD can be applied to these broader human datasets, some adjustments are necessary.
The current version of AMSD assumes each genetic marker in an individual is of one of two types and doesn't account for situations where a mix of both types (heterozygous genotypes) might be present.
This limitation means our method is best suited for analyzing data from populations like the BXD mouse strains, where many generations of inbreeding have made nearly all their genes homozygous.
To extend the utility of AMSD to more genetically diverse, outbred populations that reproduce sexually, we'll need to refine the method to handle the complexity of heterozygous genotypes.

In our study titled "Epistasis between mutator alleles contributes to germline mutation rate variability in laboratory mice," we explored how certain genetic variations, known as mutator alleles, influence the rate of mutations passed through generations in mice.
Our findings suggest that while natural selection likely limits the prevalence of mutator alleles with significant impacts, we could potentially identify a subset of these alleles by analyzing genetic data from a large number of human family groups, or trios [@PMID:35666194].
Moreover, these mutator alleles tend to affect only specific types of mutations.
Therefore, by examining the patterns of these mutations, researchers might have a better chance of pinpointing the genes responsible for differences in hereditary mutation rates, even when the influence of each gene on the overall mutation rate per generation is relatively small.
