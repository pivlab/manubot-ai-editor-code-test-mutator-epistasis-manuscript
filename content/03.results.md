### A novel method for detecting mutator alleles

We developed a new statistical method named "aggregate mutation spectrum distance" (AMSD) to identify genetic locations linked to variations in mutation patterns among recombinant inbred lines (RILs), as shown in Figure {@fig:distance-method} and detailed in the Materials and Methods section.
This method capitalizes on the unique signatures that mutator alleles, which slightly increase mutation rates, imprint on the mutation spectrum.
We start with a population of haplotypes, each genotyped at the same set of biallelic locations and each carrying new mutations categorized by their $k$-mer context (refer to Figure @fig:distance-method).
For each location, we compute a cosine distance between the combined mutation spectra of haplotypes with different parental alleles.
Through permutation tests, we pinpoint locations where these distances significantly exceed what would be expected by chance.
Additionally, to address the influence of multiple genes on the mutation process that might be common among BXDs, we adjust these distances by regressing them against the genetic similarity between haplotype groups.
We then determine significance using these adjusted distances, referred to as "adjusted" cosine distances, as described in the Materials and Methods section.

In our study, we used simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, AMSD, in identifying mutator alleles based on their impact on the mutation rate of specific DNA sequences, known as $k$-mers.
Our findings, illustrated in Figure {@fig:simulations}, show that AMSD's ability to detect mutator alleles largely depends on two factors: the initial mutation rate of the affected $k$-mer and the total number of new (de novo) mutations analyzed.
For instance, with 100 haplotypes each having an average of 500 new germline mutations, AMSD can successfully identify a mutator allele that increases the C>A mutation rate by at least 20% with about 90% accuracy.
However, its success rate drops below 20% for detecting a mutator allele with the same effect size but on the C>G mutation rate, which are less common in the germline mutation pool to start with.

Our simulations also reveal that AMSD is effective at finding mutator alleles with a significant impact, such as those increasing a specific $k$-mer's mutation rate by 50%, even when the number of mutations per haplotype is relatively low (Figure {@fig:simulations}).
When comparing AMSD to traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in identifying alleles that affect individual 1-mer mutation rates, both methods show similar capabilities (Figure {@fig:ihd_vs_qtl_power}).
Yet, AMSD has several potential benefits for discovering mutator alleles.
It performs better than QTL mapping in scenarios where the number of new mutations varies significantly across haplotypes—by up to 20 times (Figure {@fig:ihd_vs_qtl_power_variable_counts})—and when the frequency of mutator alleles is below 50% (Figure {@fig:ihd_vs_qtl_power_variable_afs}).

However, it's important to note that the parameters used in our simulations, such as the number of haplotypes and mutations and expected allele frequencies, are tailored to the BXD mouse population.
Therefore, the effectiveness of AMSD in detecting mutator alleles in other populations may vary.

**Overview of aggregate mutation spectrum distance method for discovering mutator alleles.** 
**a)** A population of four haplotypes has been genotyped at three informative markers ($g_1$ through $g_3$); each haplotype also harbors unique *de novo* germline mutations.
In practice, *de novo* mutations are partitioned by $k$-mer context; for simplicity in this toy example, *de novo* mutations are simply classified into two possible mutation types (grey squares represent C>(A/T/G) mutations, while grey triangles represent A>(C/T/G) mutations).
**b)** At each informative marker $g_n$, we calculate the total number of each mutation type observed on haplotypes that carry either parental allele (i.e., the aggregate mutation spectrum) using all genome-wide *de novo* mutations. 
For example, haplotypes with *A* (orange) genotypes at $g_1$ carry a total of three "triangle" mutations and five "square" mutations, and haplotypes with *B* (green) genotypes carry a total of six triangle and two square mutations.
We then calculate the cosine distance between the two aggregate mutation spectra, which we call the "aggregate mutation spectrum distance." 
Cosine distance can be defined as $1 - \cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between two vectors; in this case, the two vectors are the two aggregate spectra.
We repeat this process for every informative marker $g_n$. 
**c)** To assess the significance of any distance peaks in b), we perform permutation tests. 
In each of $N$ permutations, we shuffle the haplotype labels associated with the *de novo* mutation data, run a genome-wide distance scan, and record the maximum cosine distance encountered at any locus in the scan. 
Finally, we calculate the $1 - p$ percentile of the distribution of those maximum distances to obtain a genome-wide cosine distance threshold at the specified value of $p$.

### Re-identifying a mutator allele on chromosome 4 in the BXDs

In our study titled 'Epistasis between mutator alleles contributes to germline mutation rate variability in laboratory mice', we analyzed 117 BXD strains, examining a total of 65,552 new germline mutations.
By assessing these mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context, we identified a significant genetic region on chromosome 4 that influences mutation spectrum variability.
This finding is depicted in Figure 1a, where the most pronounced variation (adjusted cosine distance of 0.012) was observed at marker ID 'rs27509845', located at 118.28 million base pairs (Mbp) in the GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome reference.
The confidence in this location's significance is supported by a 90% bootstrap confidence interval ranging from 114.79 to 118.75 Mbp.

In our study, we utilized quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to pinpoint a specific area on chromosome 4 that significantly influences the C>A germline mutation rate in BXD strains of laboratory mice.
Our findings, detailed in Figure @fig:spectra-comparison, reveal that this locus, which encompasses 21 protein-coding genes related to "DNA repair," coincides with a notable increase in C>A germline mutations.
Among these genes, only *Mutyh* shows variation between the two parent strains.
The *Mutyh* gene plays a crucial role in repairing DNA damage caused by oxidative stress, specifically by correcting errors involving 8-oxoguanine, a common DNA lesion.
This process is essential for preventing C>A mutations.
We observed that BXD strains inheriting the *D* genotype at marker ID `rs27509845`—the marker associated with the highest mutation rate variability on chromosome 4—exhibit C>A germline mutation rates nearly 50% higher than those with the *B* genotype.
This significant difference underscores the impact of the *Mutyh* gene on mutation rate variability in these laboratory mice.

### An additional germline mutator allele on chromosome 6

After confirming the capability of AMSD to identify the mutator locus overlapping *Mutyh*, we proceeded to explore its effectiveness in pinpointing additional mutator loci within the BXD strains.
To avoid complications from the prominent mutator locus on chromosome 4 affecting our mutation spectrum analysis, we conducted AMSD scans with a condition on the presence of either *D* or *B* alleles at `rs27509845`.
This approach was also aimed at uncovering possible interactions between alleles at the chromosome 4 locus and mutator alleles located elsewhere in the genome.
For this purpose, we categorized the BXD strains based on their genotypes at `rs27509845` into two groups: one with *D* alleles (66 strains) and another with *B* alleles (44 strains), excluding 7 heterozygous strains.
Additionally, we removed BXD68 from this analysis due to its unique C>A mutator allele with a significantly larger effect, as previously identified.
We then conducted separate aggregate mutation spectrum distance scans for each group, as illustrated in Figure {@fig:distance-results}b-c.

In our study, we investigated the BXD mouse strains with *D* genotypes at the `rs27509845` marker.
We pinpointed a significant genetic region on chromosome 6 linked to variations in the mutation spectrum (see Figure {@fig:distance-results}b).
This region showed a peak association with a maximum adjusted cosine distance of 3.69e-3 at the `rs46276051` marker, located at 111.27 Mbp according to GRCm38/mm10 coordinates.
The confidence interval for this finding spans from 95.01 to 114.02 Mbp, indicating a high level of precision in our results.
Notably, this association was only found in BXD strains with the *D* genotype at `rs27509845`, as our analysis did not reveal any significant mutator loci in BXD strains with the *B* genotype at this marker (refer to Figure {@fig:distance-results}c).
Additionally, we found that the peak markers on chromosomes 4 and 6 were not closely linked (with an $R^2$ value of 4e-5), suggesting independent effects.
Further analysis, including Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) scans for individual mutation types, did not identify any loci with significant genome-wide effects (see Figure {@fig:qtl-scans}).
This comprehensive approach underscores the complexity of genetic factors influencing mutation rates in laboratory mice.

In our analysis of the region around the primary marker on chromosome 6, within the 90% bootstrap confidence interval, we identified 64 protein-coding genes.
Among these, four were linked to "DNA repair" based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms: *Fancd2*, *Ogg1*, *Setmar*, and *Rad18*.
The rest did not have cellular functions clearly related to a germline mutator phenotype.
It's important to note that GO annotations can sometimes be incomplete or inaccurate.
While our study primarily focused on DNA repair genes, it's possible that other genes in this region might also contribute to the C>A mutator phenotype observed in the BXDs.

In our analysis of DNA repair genes located within the specified confidence interval, we identified two with nonsynonymous differences between the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J parent strains (Table @tbl:nonsyn-diffs).
The genes in question, *Ogg1* and *Setmar*, play critical roles in the DNA repair process.
*Ogg1* is involved in the base-excision repair mechanism, specifically responding to oxidative DNA damage, a pathway that also includes *Mutyh*.
Meanwhile, *Setmar* is responsible for encoding a SET domain-containing histone methyltransferase, and both genes are active in the reproductive cells of mice.
Due to the known limitations of bootstrap methods in providing accurate coverage in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies, as noted in previous research [@PMID:16783000], we expanded our search to include genes within a +/- 5 Mbp range from the peak marker on chromosome 6.
Although selecting a 10 Mbp interval might seem arbitrary, this range led us to identify another promising candidate, *Mbd4*.
This gene, which also exhibits a nonsynonymous difference between the parental strains, is a part of the base excision repair process (Table @tbl:nonsyn-diffs).

| Gene name | Ensembl transcript name | Nucleotide change | Amino acid change | Position in GRCm38/mm10 coordinates | PhyloP conservation score | SIFT prediction | 
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | 
| *Setmar* | ENSMUST00000049246 | C>T | p.Leu103Phe | chr6:108,075,853 | 0.422 | 0.0 (intolerant/deleterious) |
| *Setmar* | ENSMUST00000049246 | T>G | p.Ser273Arg | chr6:108,076,365 | -0.355 | 0.3 (tolerant/benign) |

| *Mbd4* | ENSMUST00000032469 | C>T | p.Asp129Asn | chr6:115,849,644 | 2.28 | 0.02 (intolerant/deleterious) |

We also explored the idea that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), instead of nonsynonymous mutations, might be responsible for the C>A mutator phenotype linked to the chromosome 6 locus.
Using GeneNetwork, we identified eQTLs for five DNA repair genes, including *Mbd4*, across various tissues, although we lacked expression data from germline cells.
Notably, *D* alleles close to the peak of cosine distance on chromosome 6 were significantly linked to reduced *Ogg1* expression in the kidney, liver, hippocampus, and gastrointestinal tissues, as shown in Table 1.
Despite the difficulty in interpreting these cis-eQTLs due to their tissue-specific nature and our inability to access germline expression data, the identification of strong cis-eQTLs affecting *Ogg1* supports the notion that regulatory variants, rather than changes in protein structure, could influence the C>A mutator phenotype seen in BXD mice.

Finally, we queried a dataset of structural variants (SVs) identified via high-quality, long-read assembly of inbred laboratory mouse strains [@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100291] and found 176 large insertions or deletions (>100 bp) within the 90% bootstrap confidence interval around the cosine distance peak on chromosome 6; none overlapped the exonic sequences of protein-coding genes.

<!-- , though none of the genes has a previously annotated role in DNA repair or replication, or in a pathway that would likely affect germline mutation rates. -->

One protein-coding gene involved in DNA repair (*Rad18*) harbored an intronic deletion within the interval on chromosome 6 (chr6:112,629,618-112,636,619); however, additional experimental evidence will be needed to probe the functional impact of this structural variant.

### Evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles

We further detailed the impact of mutator alleles on chromosomes 4 and 6 on mutation patterns in BXD mice.
Our analysis focused on identifying the specific types of mutations associated with the significant variation observed on chromosome 6.
By examining the frequency of each mutation type in BXD strains with different genotypes at specific genetic markers, we discovered a notable increase in C>A mutations in strains carrying the mutator allele on chromosome 6 compared to those without it (Chi-square = 85.36, p < 0.0001).
Specifically, strains with mutator alleles on both chromosomes exhibited a higher proportion of C>A mutations than those with the allele on only one chromosome (Figures 1a and 2).
This trend did not hold for strains with the non-mutator allele at the locus overlapping with the gene *Mutyh*, where the presence of a mutator allele on chromosome 6 did not lead to a significant increase in C>A mutations (Figure 1a).

When considering the duration of inbreeding, strains with mutator alleles on both chromosomes consistently showed the highest counts of C>A mutations (Figure 1b).
Predictive models indicated that after 100 generations of inbreeding, these strains would accumulate approximately 238.9 C>A mutations, which is about 20% more than the 199.0 mutations expected in strains with one mutator and one non-mutator allele across the two examined chromosomes (Figure 1b).

We utilized SigProfilerExtractor to analyze the germline mutations in each BXD strain, categorizing them according to the single-base substitution (SBS) mutation signatures from the COSMIC catalog.
These mutation signatures can indicate the sources of DNA damage, whether they are from internal processes or external factors, and the distribution of specific SBS signatures can hint at the underlying causes of the mutations.
The analysis revealed that the SBS1, SBS5, and SBS30 signatures were present in almost all BXD strains, showing no preference for specific genotypes at the chromosome 4 and 6 mutator sites, as illustrated in Figure 3c.
In contrast, the SBS18 signature, primarily associated with C>A mutations and indicative of DNA damage from reactive oxygen species, was predominantly found in mice carrying the *D* allele at the chromosome 4 locus.
This signature was most prevalent in mice with the *D* allele at both mutator sites, as shown in Figure 3c.
Notably, the presence of the *D* allele at the chromosome 6 site alone resulted in the lowest SBS18 activity (Figure 3c), indicating that this allele by itself does not lead to a high mutation rate.
This analysis underscores the complex interplay between specific alleles at these loci and their impact on mutation signatures in the germline of laboratory mice.

To accurately assess the combined influence of specific genetic markers on mutation rates, we applied a generalized (Poisson) linear model.
This model was designed to predict the frequency of C>A mutations in each BXD strain, considering the genetic makeup at two key markers, `rs27509845` and `rs46276051`.
These markers were selected based on their significant adjusted cosine distance at the mutator loci.
Additionally, the model adjusted for variations in inbreeding duration and sequencing coverage among the BXD strains, as detailed in the *Materials and Methods* section.
Our analysis revealed that incorporating an interaction term between the genotypes at these two markers significantly improved the model's fit compared to a model that only included their additive effects (p = 7.92e-7; *Materials and Methods*).
This finding suggests that the impact of having both markers' *D* genotypes together on mutation rates is greater than the sum of their individual effects.

**c)** Germline mutations in each BXD were assigned to COSMIC SBS mutation signatures using SigProfilerExtractor [@PMID:36388765]. After grouping BXDs by their genotypes at `rs27509845` and `rs46276051`, we calculated the fraction of mutations in each group that was attributed to each signature. The proposed etiologies of each mutation signature are: SBS1 (spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine nucleotides at CpG contexts), SBS5 (unknown, clock-like signature), SBS18 (damage by reactive oxygen species, related to SBS36 and defective base-excision repair due to loss-of-function mutations in MUTYH), and SBS30 (defective base-excision repair due to NTHL1 mutations).

To investigate the impact of two specific mutator genes on genetic variation in laboratory mice, we analyzed the germline mutation patterns in strains from the Sanger Mouse Genomes Project (MGP).
Previous work by Dumont identified unique germline mutations in each of the 29 MGP strains, which are likely recent *de novo* mutations (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison-mgp}).
Among these strains, only DBA/1J and DBA/2J carry the *D* genotype at both mutator gene locations on chromosomes 4 and 6.
We examined the possibility of interaction (epistasis) between these mutator genes in the MGP strains by using two linear models to predict the frequency of C>A mutations based on the genotypes at these loci.
The comparison revealed that a model including an interaction term did not provide a significantly better fit to the data than one assuming additive effects alone (p = 0.806).
This result suggests we could not detect epistasis between these genes in the MGP strains, possibly due to the limited number of strains with available *de novo* germline mutation data.

### Some of the candidate mutator alleles are segregating in wild mice 

To investigate if certain mutator alleles on chromosome 6 were present in wild mouse populations, we analyzed sequencing data from 67 wild-derived mice, covering three *Mus musculus* subspecies and the outgroup *Mus spretus*.
Our analysis revealed that the *Ogg1* mutation (*D* allele) occurred with a frequency of 25.9% in *Mus musculus domesticus*, the primary genetic source for the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J laboratory strains.
This allele was universally present (*fixed*) in the other two *Mus musculus* subspecies and *Mus spretus* (see Figure for allele frequencies in wild populations).
The *Setmar* mutation (p.Ser273Arg *D* allele) was found in *Mus musculus domesticus* at a frequency of 37%, whereas the *Setmar* (p.Leu103Phe) and *Mbd4* (p.Asp129Asn) mutations were not detected in any of the wild *Mus musculus domesticus* specimens (refer to Figure for detailed allele frequencies).
