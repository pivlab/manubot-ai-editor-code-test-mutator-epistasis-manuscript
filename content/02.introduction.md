## Introduction

Germline mutation rates are influenced by DNA proofreading and repair pathways, external sources of DNA damage, and life-history traits.
Parental age is a key factor affecting mutation rate variability, with the number of new mutations in offspring increasing as parents age in many mammalian species (Jones et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; White et al., 2020; Black et al., 2019).
Mutation accumulation rates vary among human families, likely due to genetic differences or environmental exposures (Green et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2019).
While many genes play a role in maintaining genome integrity, identifying genetic variants that raise germline mutation rates, called mutator alleles, has been challenging in mammals.

The scarcity of observed germline mutators in mammalian genomes is not surprising.
Mutations that increase germline mutation rates would likely have harmful effects and be eliminated by negative selection if they have significant impacts.
Additionally, germline mutation rates are generally low, and accurately measuring mutation rates requires whole-genome sequencing data from both parents and their offspring.
Therefore, large-scale association studies, which have been effective in identifying common genetic variants associated with many complex traits, currently lack the power to explore the polygenic nature of germline mutation rates.

Despite facing challenges, researchers have utilized unconventional methods to discover a small number of mutator alleles in humans, macaques (Smith et al., 2023), and mice.
For instance, a recent study focused on families with rare genetic diseases and identified two mutator alleles that significantly increased *de novo* germline mutation rates in human genomes (Jones et al., 2021).
Additionally, other studies have observed mutator phenotypes in both germline and somatic tissues of adults carrying cancer-predisposing inherited mutations in the POLE/POLD1 exonucleases (Brown et al., 2022; White et al., 2023).
Furthermore, candidate mutator loci were identified by analyzing human haplotypes from the Thousand Genomes Project, which showed an excess of derived alleles in specific genomic windows (Black et al., 2016).

In a recent study, researchers identified a germline mutator allele in mice by analyzing a large family of inbred mice.
These mice, known as the BXDs, were created from crosses between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J laboratory strains, which have different germline mutation patterns.
The BXDs were bred through sibling mating for many generations, resulting in the accumulation of hundreds or thousands of germline mutations on a mosaic of parental haplotypes.
The controlled laboratory environment in which the BXDs were raised minimized the impact of environmental factors and reduced the effects of selection on new mutations.

In a recent study, researchers used whole-genome sequencing data from the BXD family to identify a genetic region associated with an increase in C>A mutation rates in the germline of mice.
This mutation rate was about 50% higher in mice with specific genetic markers at this region, known as a quantitative trait locus (QTL), potentially due to variations in a gene called *Mutyh*, which is involved in repairing oxidative DNA damage.
Mutations in *Mutyh* have also been linked to increased mutation rates in both human germline and somatic cells.
Although the QTL did not show strong associations with overall germline mutation rates, which were only slightly elevated in mice with specific genetic markers, analyzing the mutation spectrum proved valuable in identifying mutator alleles.
By examining the specific types of mutations present in the DNA sequences, researchers can pinpoint genes involved in DNA repair and proofreading, which often have preferences for certain DNA sequence patterns or types of DNA damage.
Mutation spectra are typically categorized based on nucleotide context, with the 1-mer spectrum including 6 types of mutations and the 3-mer spectrum containing 96 variations based on trinucleotide context.

Mutation spectrum analysis is a valuable tool for identifying mutator alleles that impact specific mutation rates.
However, early applications of this approach have faced challenges.
For instance, conducting association tests on the rates or proportions of every $k$-mer mutation type can lead to a significant burden of multiple testing.
Additionally, due to the typically low germline mutation rates, estimates of $k$-mer mutation type frequencies from individual samples may be noisy and imprecise.
Furthermore, the duration of inbreeding can vary widely among samples in populations of recombinant inbred lines (RILs); some BXDs were inbred for just 20 generations, while others underwent nearly 200 generations of inbreeding.
Consequently, the variability in individual $k$-mer mutation rate estimates within these populations is much higher than if all samples had been inbred for the same duration.
This motivated us to develop a statistical method that could address the sparse nature of *de novo* mutation spectra, eliminate the need to test each $k$-mer mutation type individually, and facilitate the sensitive identification of alleles influencing the germline mutation spectrum.

In this study, we introduce a novel test called the "aggregate mutation spectrum distance" to analyze mutation spectra more effectively while reducing the need for multiple tests and addressing data sparsity issues in *de novo* mutation datasets.
Using this method, we re-examined germline mutation data from the BXD family and identified a previously undetected mutator allele that interacts with a known mutator allele in the BXDs.
This interaction enhances the C>A germline mutation rate in certain inbred mice.
Our findings suggest that mild DNA repair deficiencies can have a cumulative effect, with mutator alleles compromising the redundant systems that safeguard germline integrity.
