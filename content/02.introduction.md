## Introduction

The rate at which mutations accumulate in the germline, the cells responsible for passing genetic material to offspring, is influenced by a complex mix of factors.
These include the mechanisms that correct DNA errors, repair damaged DNA, external factors that can harm DNA, and various life-history characteristics.
One significant factor affecting mutation rate variability is the age of the parents.
Studies have shown that the number of new mutations found in the offspring tends to increase with both the father's and mother's age across many mammal species (references).
Additionally, the rate at which mutations accumulate can differ significantly between human families (references), which may be attributed to genetic differences or varying environmental factors that individuals are exposed to.
While a large number of genes are known to play a role in protecting the integrity of our genetic information, identifying specific genetic variations, known as mutator alleles, that lead to higher rates of mutations in the germline has been challenging in mammals.

The scarcity of identified germline mutators, which are genetic variants that increase mutation rates in the reproductive cells of mammals, isn't entirely unexpected.
This is because variants that significantly raise the mutation rates in germline cells could have harmful effects and thus be eliminated by natural selection processes if their impacts are substantial.
Additionally, germline mutation rates are typically low, and accurately measuring these rates requires analyzing the complete genetic information from both parents and their offspring through whole-genome sequencing.
Consequently, large-scale studies that have been instrumental in identifying how common genetic variants influence various complex traits are not yet effective for exploring the complex genetic basis of germline mutation rates.
This limitation is due to the challenges in gathering and analyzing the necessary genetic data from families (Greenwood and Kelso, 2017; Besenbacher et al., 2020).

Despite facing numerous challenges, researchers have employed innovative strategies to identify a select number of mutator alleles, which are genetic variants that increase the mutation rate, in humans, macaques, and mice.
For instance, by studying families affected by rare genetic disorders, a recent investigation uncovered two mutator alleles responsible for significantly higher rates of new (de novo) germline mutations in human genomes.
Additionally, several studies have reported the presence of mutator phenotypes—conditions where the mutation rate is increased—in both the reproductive cells and body cells of adults who have inherited mutations linked to cancer, specifically in the POLE/POLD1 exonucleases, enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair.
Furthermore, researchers have pinpointed potential mutator loci, or specific locations on a chromosome that affect the mutation rate, by analyzing human genetic variations from the Thousand Genomes Project and identifying those with an unusually high number of mutations within certain sections of the genome.

In recent research, scientists discovered a specific genetic variant in mice, known as a germline mutator allele, by studying a large group of closely related mice through genetic sequencing.
This discovery was made within a special group of laboratory mice called BXDs.
These BXDs are a product of breeding between two different strains of mice, namely C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, which are known to have distinct genetic mutation patterns in their germline, or reproductive cells.
This breeding process involved either second-generation offspring (F2) or more complex breeding schemes, leading to the creation of these unique recombinant inbred lines (RILs).

The BXD mice have been bred within their own family lines, through brother-sister mating, for as many as 180 generations.
This extensive inbreeding has resulted in each BXD line accumulating a large number of germline mutations.
These mutations are spread across a genetic background that is almost entirely made up of a mix of the original C57BL/6J and DBA/2J parental genetic material.
This unique genetic makeup makes the BXDs an invaluable resource for studying the effects of genetic mutations.

One of the key advantages of using BXDs for genetic research is their upbringing in a highly controlled laboratory environment.
This setting minimizes the impact of external environmental factors on the mice, allowing scientists to focus on the genetic aspects of their studies.
Moreover, the strict inbreeding practice helps to reduce the influence of natural selection on new, or de novo, mutations.
This controlled breeding and environment make the BXDs an ideal model for investigating how genetic variations, such as the germline mutator allele, contribute to differences in the rate of genetic mutations across different mouse lines.

In a previous study, researchers analyzed the whole-genome sequencing data from the BXD mouse family to identify a specific genetic region (quantitative trait locus or QTL) associated with the rate of C>A mutations (a type of genetic mutation) (PMID:35545679).
They discovered that mice with a particular genetic variation (*D* haplotypes) at this QTL had C>A mutation rates nearly 50% higher than others.
This increase in mutation rate was likely due to variations in the *Mutyh* gene, which plays a crucial role in repairing oxidative DNA damage.
Similar variations in the *Mutyh* gene have also been found to increase mutation rates in both the germline (cells leading to eggs and sperm) and somatic (body) cells in humans (PMID:35803914; PMID:30753674).

Interestingly, this genetic region did not show a significant association with overall germline mutation rates in the BXD mice, which were only slightly higher in mice with the *D* alleles.
This highlights the importance of analyzing the mutation spectrum – the types and contexts of mutations – to uncover genes that may increase mutation rates.
Analyzing the mutation spectrum can be particularly useful because genes involved in DNA repair often target specific sequences or types of damage (PMID:32619789).

Mutation spectra can vary in complexity, from simple 1-mer spectra, which include 6 types of mutations, to more detailed 3-mer spectra, which can differentiate 96 types of mutations based on the surrounding nucleotide sequence.
This level of detail helps researchers understand the specific contexts in which mutations are more likely to occur.

The study of mutation spectrum analysis holds the potential to uncover mutator alleles, which are genetic variations that influence the frequency of specific types of mutations.
However, early efforts to leverage this approach encountered several challenges.
One significant issue is that analyzing the rates or proportions of mutations for each possible sequence change (referred to as $k$-mer mutation types) can lead to a high burden of statistical testing due to the sheer number of comparisons being made.
This is problematic because the rate at which mutations occur in the germline is typically low, making the data derived from individual samples both noisy and imprecise.
Additionally, the extent of inbreeding, which can vary widely in populations of recombinant inbred lines (RILs), affects the variability of mutation rate estimates.
For instance, within the BXD mouse strains, the number of inbreeding generations ranges from as few as 20 to nearly 200.
This variation in inbreeding duration means that the estimated mutation rates for individual sequence changes can vary significantly, complicating the analysis further.

To address these issues, our research aimed to devise a statistical method capable of navigating the sparse nature of de novo mutation spectra.
Our goal was to create a tool that would not only eliminate the necessity of testing each mutation type individually but also enhance the ability to detect alleles that have a significant impact on the germline mutation spectrum.
This effort is crucial for advancing our understanding of genetic variability and its underlying mechanisms in laboratory mice, contributing to the broader field of genetic research.

In this study, we introduce a novel approach for analyzing genetic mutations, named the "aggregate mutation spectrum distance." This method effectively reduces the complexity of handling multiple tests and addresses the issue of limited data, which often complicates the analysis of new genetic mutations.
Utilizing this technique, we revisited genetic data from the BXD mouse lineage and uncovered strong evidence for an additional mutator gene that had been missed by earlier studies.
This newly identified gene seems to work in tandem with a previously discovered mutator gene in the BXD mice, significantly increasing the rate of C>A mutations in the germline of certain inbred mice.
Our findings indicate that even slight weaknesses in DNA repair mechanisms can have a cumulative effect, as these mutator genes gradually undermine the various defense mechanisms that protect the integrity of germline DNA.
