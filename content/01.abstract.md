## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The essential and immensely complex issue of maintaining germline genome integrity involves hundreds of proteins responsible for DNA replication, proofreading, and repair [@PMID:28485537].
While loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding these proteins can result in increased mutation rates, the detection of *mutator alleles* in mammals has been challenging.
DNA replication and repair proteins often target specific sequence motifs or excise lesions at particular nucleotides, suggesting that the spectrum of *de novo* mutations (such as C>T, A>G, etc.) may vary between genomes with mutator or wild-type alleles at a specific locus.
Previous research utilized quantitative trait locus mapping to identify potential mutator alleles in the DNA repair gene *Mutyh*, which elevated the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXD inbred mouse family [@PMID:35545679;@PMID:33472028].
In this study, a novel method called "aggregate mutation spectrum distance" was developed to identify alleles linked to mutation spectrum variability.
Analysis of mutation data from the BXDs confirmed the presence of a germline mutator locus near *Mutyh* and revealed an additional C>A mutator locus on chromosome 6 overlapping with *Ogg1*, a DNA glycosylase in the same repair network as *Mutyh* [@PMID:17581577].
The impact of a chromosome 6 mutator allele was dependent on the presence of a mutator allele near *Mutyh*, with BXDs carrying mutator alleles at both loci exhibiting higher numbers of C>A mutations compared to those with mutator alleles at only one locus.
These new methods for analyzing mutation spectra highlight evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles and have potential applications in studying mutation data across humans and other model organisms.
